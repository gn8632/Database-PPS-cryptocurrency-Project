csc 6710-pps

Data base class project. 

My partner and I created a dynamic website using JAVA, JSP, HTML, CSS, and MySql databases. Users can register a new account or sign in using an existing account. 

The website lets users deposit money, withdraw money, buy PPS,  sell PPS, and transfer PPS (PPS is a digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin and dogecoin). 

Users can deposit money to PPS account from the bank and withdraw money back from the PPS account. They can also buy PPS from the root user (creator or owner) and sell PPS back to the root user. Users can transfer PPS to the user they are following. They can check common users. 

The website shows the most recent 15 transactions on the transaction page. Project Part 3 link shows Frequent buyers, Biggest buy, Biggest buyers, Popular users, Neverbuy users, Neversell users, Lucky users, Inactive users, and Statistics.
